              <p>
                As a Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Technology student, I am passionate about the 
                intersection of clinical diagnostics and patient care. My journey in medical laboratory 
                sciences began with a fascination for how laboratory diagnostics provide the foundation 
                for evidence-based healthcare decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently pursuing my degree at University Medical College, where I've developed 
                proficiency in various laboratory techniques, from routine biochemical testing to 
                specialized molecular diagnostics. My academic focus includes hematology, clinical 
                chemistry, immunology, and molecular biology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond technical skills, I value the critical role medical laboratory professionals play 
                in healthcare teams, providing accurate diagnostic information that guides treatment 
                decisions and improves patient outcomes.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">My Approach</h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>
              I believe in the power of accurate diagnostics to transform healthcare. Every sample 
              represents a patient whose treatment depends on precise analysis and interpretation. 
              This responsibility drives my commitment to excellence in laboratory practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              My approach combines technical precision with continuous learning. The field of medical 
              laboratory technology is constantly evolving with new diagnostic methods, automation 
              systems, and research findings. Staying current with these developments is essential for 
              providing the highest quality diagnostic services.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm particularly interested in how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence 
              and advanced molecular techniques can enhance traditional laboratory methods, improving 
              both efficiency and diagnostic accuracy.
